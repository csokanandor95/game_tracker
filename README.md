ðŸŽ® Game Tracker

A simple desktop application to track video games I want to play and those I have already completed. Built with Python + Tkinter, it allows me to manage my game list, assign statuses, and rate completed titles. There are so many good games out there and I only have a very limited time to play, so I like to take notes, rate and list all the games I think are worth playing. Since I play on multiple platforms (PS5, PC ((Steam, Epic, Itch.io)) and sometimes even Game Pass) I find it overwhelming to use all the different wishlists & favourites, and just want my game list and history in one place :)

Features

Rate completed games on a 1â€“10 scale
Update or delete existing entries

Persistent storage using JSON (data is saved automatically)
Clean and minimal GUI built with Tkinter

Installation & Usage

This project was initially scaffolded with the help of ChatGPT-5, which I plan on further customizing and improving for personal use.
